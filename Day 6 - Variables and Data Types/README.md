## What is a variable?

Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value.

## What is a Data Type?

Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.

## 1. Numeric data: int, float, complex

int: 3, -8, 0
float: 7.349, -9.0, 0.0000001
complex: 6 + 2i

## 2. Text data: str

str: "Hello World!!!", "Python Programming"

## 3. Boolean data:

Boolean data consists of values True or False.

## 4. Sequenced data: list, tuple

- List: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.

- Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation.

## Mapped data: dict

A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.
